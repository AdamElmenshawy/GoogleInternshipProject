The flaw exists in the way the system handles memory allocation, specifically within a function called `fastrpc_mmap_find`.  This weakness could allow a malicious app or program to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or even take complete control of the device.  \n\nThe vulnerability affects Qualcomm-based Android devices released before January 5th, 2025.  Android has released software updates to fix this problem.  Device owners should update their devices to the latest software version as soon as possible to mitigate this risk.  The high severity rating indicates a significant potential impact.\n",
