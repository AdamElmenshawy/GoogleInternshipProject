An attacker with system-level access could exploit this flaw to read sensitive data from the device's storage.  No user interaction is required for the attack.

It exists in a part of the Android system responsible for audio and media processing (specifically, the \"Audio, Gesture, and Media\" or AGM component).  The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious app to cause unexpected behavior or crashes in the audio system,  potentially leading to a denial-of-service (the device's audio features stop working).  This is considered moderate risk because exploiting it wouldn't likely allow access to personal data, but it could disrupt the normal use of the device.
